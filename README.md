In this project, we have gone through the work-flow of a Machine Learning project for each of the classification and regression settings using the datasets [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)'s datasets [Cardiotocography Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cardiotocography) of fetal heart diagnosis for the classification setting, and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)'s [Sberbank Russian Housing Market](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market/overview) that consists of statistics from the Russian real estate market by: 
- Exploring each of the datasets.
- Training a baseline classifier.
- Training, cross-validating, and hyper-parameter tuning plenty of models for each set to find the best-performing model for each of the two problems.
Moreover, we have implemented Decision Tree classes using OOP for each classification and regression setting, investigating their viability to underfitting/overfitting and plotting to graph them for more interpretability.
